I made this exercise to understand when I could use InvocationHandler in Java.

In this exercise, I simulate I have a library that has some objects that maybe I couldn't modify. Therefore,
I create a proxy instance around the Teacher class and add some functionality that I would need + logging.

So, we have a library that has a simple teacher, and in our new fantastic plugin/library we take this immutable teacher
and add some functionality and logging that we need.
